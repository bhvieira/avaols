Description: This package implements the All-vs-All Ordinary Least Squares (AVAOLS) method for 
    estimating the parameters of linear models that relate a set of variables to itself.
    The method is based on the idea of, instead of fitting a single model for each variable,
    fitting a single model for all variables at once. This is done by using the
    QR decomposition of the covariance matrix of the variables.
